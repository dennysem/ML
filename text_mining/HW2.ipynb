do that on financial an issue that really have any real it allow thought had already gone farther than almost any would have spoke later in day completed know my friends on other side of aisle are faced with difficult choice between supporting their party leadership participating in this difficult am not know that is hard place if we act like senators for sake of this issue then why are we even went work for an public that is sick tired of feeling like no one is looking out for their like political lobbyists hold all cards in these minority seems intent on proving them have been here long know this institution is better than know there are friends of mine on other side of aisle who care about this who want be part of who want be part of same joined partisan accusing of lying about he air with his hand as he have ask why did go through this process over last four or five agreeing much of what they were there is not single political vote show for have say younger members coming be having heard that was returned chamber asked went long told we 10th it understand were losing on your was not gaining had that is all asked for when never said could speak for anybody but did not leave urged keep talking differences could be out in few this was not financial reform became slightly more polite repeat of reform threatened threatened thousands of lobbyists their clients more than billion was sitting in with other side of there was noise of across are being set up in little happens around here without persuaded allow bill move floor for few weeks on yet another filibuster was

said sitting in his under print of of strategy of had once again come close but he knew that of were previous had said would have loved have as my ranking member on could have had such great time on this who said that he believed in bipartisanship because people trust either political party enough give them blank was that so few voted for financial was zero substantive reason why this have been he asked him why had voted no on started talk about then want vote against can always find your seemed want vote against had spent months trying act like alienating himself from his own party then other on day of vote he held floor for better part of thirty as if he were still reluctant let effort am obviously he think have spent as much time as any on policy regarding our financial think any this good things in is no appreciate think there is lot of think not enough time was spent on some of core senators cast their noticed author of in press later asked him with passage of two big reform bills in three we were possible renewal of can engage public opinion in way politicians can public opinion can still blow away money interest he over past few decades has grown in all things better avoid than take on big is kind of thing that drives here arrived in do about destruction of final vote on financial flew leaders held press smiling before outside those who wanted protect it then he had join for telephone with was stunned that only four would join us in passing this historic does it take bring into conversation about future of with wanted demonstrate that of could conduct its business much as our founders did signed completed two lasting achievements of this financial regulation health required year half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed on set of large majority
